To start the DBMS(SQL 11g) on your PC. Go to start Oracle11g-->run SQL command line.
First we have to connect our database. Type     connect SYSTEM          then write password.

create table Patient(patId int,
                     patName char(50),
                     BloodGrp char(5)
                    );
Type --> desc Patient; <-- to see whole table.
We can see that by default the int will have space of 38 bytes.

There can be constraints on our table which can be at:
a) Table level
  1)Primary Key
  2)Foreign Key
b) Field level
  1)Unique
  2)Not null (It is also considered as Check)
  3)Check (User defined Constraint)
  4)Default

To delete table from DB we write --> drop table Patient; <--

Let we add constraints....
create table Patient(patId int primary key,
                     patName char(50) not null,
                     BloodGrp char(5) default 'A +ve',
                     contact int unique,
                     email char(50) check(email=lower(email))
                    );
 
 
Type -->desc user_constraints<-- this to see how much user constraints fields are there at the total.


Remember that when we make table it is named as uppercase in the oracle.
Following code will display constraints applied by the user.
  select constraint_name,constraint_type from user_constraints where table_name='PATIENT';
  select constraint_name,constraint_type,search_condition from user_constraints where table_name='PATIENT';



///INSERTING data in tablename
    insert into Patient values(123,'Hey1',default,9999,'pooj@gmail.com');

//Printing data of the table.
    select * from Patient;  //This will take more lines to display
    select PATID||PATNAME||BLOODGRP||CONTACT||EMAIL from Patient;
    
  The char(50) will take exactly 50 characters while writing thus to avoid this we initiallize fields as:
  varchar(50) or varchar2(50) 
  or we can simply trim(patName) while printing.
